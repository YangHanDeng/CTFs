## misc/hike to where?
(I felt guilty when I was working on this problem)
1. From the picture, we can see that this guy is from `acm at ucla`
2. Google it, I checked the official website but it doesn't work, then I checked the instagram. In `takeovers 2022`, I saw this guy called Carey
3. Then I googled ucla carey, I found his name `Carey Nachenberg`
4. I checked his personal website, Instagram, Linkedin and Facebook but nothing helped. Then I focused on another point in the picture. It shows that the picture is from an event.
5. I googled `Carey Nachenberg event` then I saw this `https://www.tickettailor.com/events/peaksprofessorsatucla/792649` it shows that they went to Skull Rock
6. I entered `lactf{skull_rock}`, then it worked!
